It’s our time to put a voice on city council with the interests of our neighbors at heart, not developers’. It’s our time to make sure our schools have the funding they need to educate the next generation. It’s our time to ensure that opportunity is available here for everyone, not just a wealthy few.

#### It’s our time to build a brighter future for the 25th Ward.
