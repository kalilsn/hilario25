Our ward is filled with vibrant neighborhoods that have been built by the residents, not developers. The residents of our community have already proven time and time again that they’re the best placed people to make decisions about development in our ward and neighborhoods. Hilario will use his authority as alderman to **ensure that zoning and development decisions are transparent and democratic**, countering attempts by moneyed interests to place profits over people.

As alderman, Hilario will…

* **Implement a transparent and inclusive community-driven zoning and development process** that makes residents and representative community-based organizations the primary decision makers in zoning and development decisions.

* **Require that developments include community benefits agreements** (CBAs) which ensure that the community is fully informed about requests made for zoning changes and their potential impact. These CBAs will also guarantee the inclusive representation of the interests of the residents of the ward in a manner that respects and fosters diversity across all demographics, and that all community groups capable of providing insights and expertise are engaged in community development decisions.

* **Implement participatory budgeting** to empower the diverse residents of the 25th Ward to make decisions for how city funding should be spent.

* Use the resources of the alderman’s office to **support local organizations working in advocacy and education** to offer workshops to the community designed to equip residents with the tools to make informed decisions that best meet their needs and vision for the ward.
