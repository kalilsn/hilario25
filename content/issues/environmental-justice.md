In Chicago, especially in areas on the southwest side like the 25th Ward, profit has long been prioritized over the health of people. Families and the 25th Ward are facing public health crises from pollution in the air they breathe to lead in the water they drink, because politicians have chosen corporate donations over communities and families.

As alderman, Hilario will…

* **Fight to shut down toxic industrial enterprises** like the Fisk Power Plant, which threaten the health of residents of the 25th Ward.

* **Urge legislation in City Council to remove lead pipes** running through Chicago’s neighborhoods making tap water unsafe.

* **Back the Water for All ordinance**, which would provide aid to low-income families facing rising water and sewage bills and work to stop the further privatization of water in the Chicago.

* **Support the efforts of community environmental justice groups** who are doing the critical on-the-ground work of identifying issues and solutions, and bring the voices and needs of these groups and community members into the rooms and conversations where policy is made.
