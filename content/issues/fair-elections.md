Every citizen deserves an equal voice in the governance decisions that affect their daily lives. But when elections are awash in big-dollar donations from private interests and profit-driven corporations, our communitiesâ€™ voices end up drowned out. Reviving the core values of American democracy require us to demand expanded transparency, genuine fairness, and proven integrity.

As alderman, Hilario will...

* **Advocate for the Fair Elections Ordinance**, which ensures that our elections are citizen- and voter-funded by establishing a small-donor matching fund that is available to candidates who agree to spending limits and restrictions. Ordinances and laws like this have proven to increase the competitiveness of elections and the diversity of candidates, giving voters more choice and a louder voice at the ballot box.

* **Ally with organizations like Common Cause (and their partner Equitable Evanston)** to develop and implement locally based solutions that make elections fairer and voting more accessible.

* **Refuse contributions from corporations** that have bought the ability to ignore the demands of the community with political donations.
