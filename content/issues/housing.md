Equitable access to affordable, high quality housing, infrastructure, and community resources is essential for both individual and community well being. In the 25th Ward in particular, money from luxury real estate developers has taken over our political establishment - leading to rezonings that favor costly residences and amenities, pushing out small businesses and working families.

**So what do we do?**

The first step is simply recognizing **housing as a human right**. Period. Housing in Chicago has become a goldmine for wealthy developers instead of the fundamental, baseline resource it should be. When we say that housing is a human right, we mean that housing should be a resource for the public good, not a commodity or speculative asset. Most importantly, **it is a resource that should be controlled by the community itself.**

As alderman, Hilario willâ€¦

* Push for legislation that would **expand access to affordable housing** by increasing the number of affordable units required in new developments, ensuring that those units are on-site (except in cases approved by the community), and eliminating the option for developers to opt out by paying a fine.

* Advocate for legislation in city council to **lift the ban on rent control**, and support community organizations and members in pushing for state legislation.

* **Support tenant protections, strong safety nets, and organizations in the community invested in working to help residents avoid homelessness**, especially for youth, people with disabilities, those experiencing mental illness, LGBTQ individuals, veterans, and those returning from incarceration.

* **Increase access at the community level to mechanisms such as land banks and trusts, limited equity cooperatives, and restricted deeds** that can be used to assist families in buying houses and prevent an unchecked or unreasonable increase in housing costs. This work will be done in collaboration with existing organizations like [Neighborhood Housing Services-Chicago](https://www.nhschicago.org/) which provide access to information and education to support and promote homeownership.
