We live in a city where enormous wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, while the workers who make our economy run are increasingly squeezed out of the middle class into poverty. This income inequality is the root of many of the problems our communities face, from increased violence to lack of affordable healthcare to displacement of longtime residents.

We need policies that support the growth of good, permanent living-wage jobs. As alderman, Hilario willâ€¦

* **Fight to increase the minimum wage to *at least* $15.** Everyone should make enough to cover their basic needs and provide a decent quality of life for themselves and their families. The first step must be to raise the current minimum wage to $15 an hour.

* **Eliminate the current two-tiered minimum wage system,** which differentiates between tipped and non-tipped workers. We need to implement one fair minimum wage for all workers.

* **Support worker-owned businesses,** known as worker cooperatives. In this business model, workers are the boss, and decisions are made democratically. Worker cooperatives are a proven way to create and maintain good, dignified jobs, improve the quality of life of workers, and promote equitable and stable local economies.

* **Work to pass the Fair Workweek Ordinance.** This ordinance would guarantee workers at least two weeks advance notice for scheduling changes and ensure workers are fairly compensated in cases of last-minute schedule changes.

* **Work to use city procurement policies to expand the right to organize and bargain collectively.** Chicago spends billions every year to feed kids in schools, provide city workers with proper vehicles and equipment, and much more. If a company seeks to do business with our city, they should respect the rights of workers and treat their employees with a baseline of dignity.

* **Champion unions.** We need elected representatives who recognize that, as vehicles of power for working people, unions have represented a profound democratizing force in our society. As alderman, Hilario will publicly stand with workers during contract negotiations, strikes and union organizing drives.
