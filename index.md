I am an educator, organizer, and Pilsen native working to champion working class families in Chicago’s City Council. It’s time the people of the 25th ward have a representative that will fight for all of our neighbors and not big money interests.

This movement in our ward is about transparency, accessibility, and accountability. It’s about education, housing, jobs, and justice. It’s about safe and healthy neighborhoods. It’s about investing in our youth. It’s about better quality constituent service. It’s about ending politics as usual. And most of all, it’s about putting people and community first.

It’s our time. Join our movement.
